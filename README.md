# üçî Fast-Food Ordering Application ‚Äì Bachelor‚Äôs Thesis Project

## üìÑ Overview

This repository contains the bachelor‚Äôs thesis developed at the **Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science**, majoring in **Computer Science**, at **Ovidius University of Constan»õa**.

The thesis involved writing over **70 pages** and developing a **graphical user interface** for a fast-food restaurant. The application offers functionalities similar to commercial apps like **Spartan** or **Glovo**, allowing users to:

- create an account;
- place online orders;
- receive a **confirmation email** with the order details.

## üë§ User Features

Regular users benefit from an intuitive experience, with access to the following features:

- **Managing their personal account data**, including banking information and shopping cart;
- Access to a **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)** section to quickly find answers to common inquiries;
- **Customizing the interface** by choosing preferred colors from an extensive palette;
- Viewing detailed information about the **ingredients used** in the preparation of each product;
- Receiving a **confirmation email** after placing an order, listing all purchased items.

## üîê Role-Based Access and Administration

A key feature of the application is the implementation of a **role-based system** that provides extended control and functionalities for users with administrative privileges.

An **administrator** can:

- add, modify, or remove products available on the platform;
- manage the ingredients of products;
- adjust the color palette available for interface customization;
- edit the content of the FAQ section;
- **assign administrative roles** to other users, thereby expanding the application's management capabilities.
